# Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Dataset (Task 5)

## Overview
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship – **Task 5**, where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

The main goal was to analyze the dataset, clean it, visualize patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes passenger data from the Titanic ship and contains the following columns:
- PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age, Fare, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Embarked, etc.

## Data Cleaning
- Filled missing `Age` values with **median**
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with **mode**
- Dropped `Cabin` column due to excessive missing data
- Converted `Age` column to **integer** type

## Key Insights
- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate
- Passengers in **1st Class** survived more than others
- Higher **fare** was correlated with survival
- Most passengers were aged between **20–40 years**

## Visualizations Used
- Histograms
- Countplots
- Scatterplots
- Correlation Heatmap
- 
## Files Included
- `EDA_Titanic_Task5.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook
- `EDA_Titanic_Report.pdf` – Exported PDF report
- `train.csv` – Dataset
- `README.md` – Project summary file



## Conclusion
This EDA helped me gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, handling missing values, data type conversion, and drawing visual insights from real-world data using Python.
